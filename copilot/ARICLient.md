Looking at the codebase structure and the recent documents, I think we made the right choice by creating a separate AriClient rather than extending the AcmeProtocolClient. Here's my reasoning:

Why AriClient is the better approach:
1. Separation of Concerns
AcmeProtocolClient handles the core ACME protocol (account management, orders, challenges, certificates)
AriClient handles the optional ARI extension which is a separate HTTP API
ARI is an informational service, not part of the core ACME workflow
2. Different HTTP Patterns
ACME Protocol: Uses signed JWS requests, nonces, account context, POST-as-GET
ARI Protocol: Simple GET requests to public endpoints, no authentication required
The existing AcmeProtocolClient is heavily tied to ACME's JWS signing and account management
3. Dependency Management
AcmeProtocolClient depends on ACMESharp library, account keys, JWS signing
AriClient only needs basic HTTP client functionality
Mixing these would create unnecessary dependencies
4. Error Handling Differences
ACME errors: Use ACME problem details format, require account context
ARI errors: Simple HTTP status codes and optional JSON error responses
Rate limiting patterns are different (ACME uses account-based limits, ARI uses IP-based)
5. Testing and Mocking
Easier to unit test ARI functionality in isolation
Can mock ARI responses without dealing with ACME protocol complexity
ARI client can be tested against real ARI endpoints without account setup
6. Future Extensibility
ARI might evolve independently from core ACME protocol
Other ACME extensions could follow similar patterns
Keeps the core ACME client focused and stable
The Current Architecture is Optimal:
This design follows single responsibility principle and makes the codebase more maintainable. The AriDirectoryService acts as the bridge between ACME directory discovery and ARI operations, which is exactly what we want.

So yes, I believe we chose the correct approach with a separate AriClient.
